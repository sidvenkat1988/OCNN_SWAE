# OCNN_SWAE
This is done as a part of my Analytics IV module. This is based on the papers [ANOMALY DETECTION USING ONE-CLASS NEURAL
NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06360.pdf) and [Sliced-Wasserstein Autoencoder: An
Embarrassingly Simple Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01947.pdf). 

Though I am getting a good accuracy purely on the basis of Autoencoder alone, a lot more needs to be done in order to improve the accuracy of OCNN.
